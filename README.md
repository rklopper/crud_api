# crud_api
Basic crud api in php

All files are inside the API folder.

None of this has been tested as I had many issues with trying to understand the Heroku and Postgresql stuff(this is my first experience with both).
I would have loved more time to try learning more about these tools but as a father to two kids(one of which is just 7 weeks old) and as someone whose current job is demanding an average of 12-14 hours of work a day, I just havent had the time I would have liked to spend on this.

I have built this api with the assumption that the frontend would be posting the data through javascript or jquery and then handling the response.

In the API folder there is the database.php file which will hopefully,(as I said before, nothing has been tested) allow the connection with the heroku database that was created for me by cartrack.

I managed to download the postgresql software and connected to the cartrack database through that. It was as I was going through those tables that I saw the client table and decided to simply build the CRUD files to connectto that table.
